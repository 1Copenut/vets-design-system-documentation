# Additional info

## Use case
Sometimes, an interaction on a benefit application or resource is so nuanced that it has labels or requirements that some users don't fully understand.

## What is Additional info
The additional info pattern is a context specific interaction where we provide users with relevant information that helps gain about the decision they are about to make. This information is hidden beneath a quasi-accordion-like interaction because it isn’t necessary for the majority of users and would impede the primary action on the page. 

## Examples

## Where to place Additional info
Whenever there is a chance to enhance the understanding a user has about a particular choice, the additional info interaction can be used! —for instance:
A user might need to list conditions they have in a disabilities form. We ask them: 
Search the name of your condition
And the additional info interaction would be:
“What if I don’t know the name of my condition? >”
When the user clicks, they see an explanation of what to search for, and an example search to further illustrate the explanation.

## Pattern specifics
The [current component of the Additional info](https://design.va.gov/components/additional-info) interaction has a dotted line underneath it, along with a down-carat to indicate interactivity

### Do: 
Help users by providing contextual, relevant information that brings clarity to content they are taking action. 

### Don’t:
Don’t use this pattern to house information that is critical to the form or content relevant to the specific interaction a users has to take.
