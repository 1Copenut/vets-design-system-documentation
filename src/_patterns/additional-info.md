## Additional info
I'm editing this comment to add some structure that I unabashedly stole from @lalexanderson-dsva 

#### Use case
Sometimes, an interaction on a benefit application or resource is so nuanced that it has labels or requirements that some users don't fully understand.

#### What is Additional info
The additional info pattern is a context specific interaction where we provide users with relevant information that helps gain about the decision they are about to make. This information is hidden beneath a quasi-accordion-like interaction because it isn‚Äôt necessary for the majority of users and would impede the primary action on the page. 

#### Examples

#### Where to place Additional info
Whenever there is a chance to enhance the understanding a user has about a particular choice, the additional info interaction can be used! ‚Äîfor instance:
A user might need to list conditions they have in a disabilities form. We ask them: 
Search the name of your condition
And the additional info interaction would be:
‚ÄúWhat if I don‚Äôt know the name of my condition? >‚Äù
When the user clicks, they see an explanation of what to search for, and an example search to further illustrate the explanation.

#### Pattern specifics
‚Ä¢ The [current iteration of the Additional info](https://design.va.gov/components/additional-info) interaction has a dotted line underneath it, along with a down-carat to indicate interactivity

‚Ä¢ Do: 
Help users by providing contextual, relevant information that brings clarity to content they are taking action. 

‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt:
Don‚Äôt use this pattern to house information that is critical to the form or content relevant to the specific interaction a users has to take.  

@goldenmeanie @smoonpeyes @jaredcunha-usds some thoughts:
1. Do we want to continue calling this "Additional info"?
2. There is at least one instance of this pattern used in an alert that feels weird to me from a UX/pattern perspective which is the [Homeless alert](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/) we have on a few pages. I have no idea what to do about this (well, that's not true, i have strong opinions about what to do about it, but that's just me üòÑ). Which leads me to‚Ä¶
3. How do we want to approach improving patterns we know could be better (this example or otherwise)?
