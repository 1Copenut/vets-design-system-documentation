# Patterns

Patterns are solutions and researched best practices that solve recurring user interface design problems:

* How do you organize web forms?
* How do you provide navigational context?
* How do you handle progressive disclosure?

## How are they different from components?

Patterns are design solutions, whereas a component can be considered a UI chunk. In Formation, patterns are typically built with a combination of components and utility classes, and therefore, do not have a class prefix attributed to them.

Because they address specific user needs, a pattern is more than the sum of its parts.

Components can be considered concrete, a finite list: buttons, accordions, tables, etc. Patterns might be unique to a site or or an application, and may evolve with changes in technology or after competitive analysis.
