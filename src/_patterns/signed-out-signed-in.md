# Signed in vs. signed out
On VA.gov, there are a few differences between the signed in and signed out states.


## Site header
The site header appears globally at the top of every page. Its appearance is responsive to the userâ€™s browser size.

## Contextual CTAs (calls to action)
A contextual CTA is used when an action is required or recommended before a user starts a process (like applying for a VA benefit.) Contextual CTAs are placed within a larger chunk of content on a page. Placement depends on its importance compared to other content on the page. Often it is placed immediately after introduction text on a page.

### When is a contextual CTA appropriate?
Use a contextual CTA when:
* The user is required to do something before starting a process
* The user would benefit from doing something before starting a process
* The CTA includes important supplemental information
* An error has occurred and the user is blocked from proceeding

Use the [alert box component]() for contextual CTAs.

### Possible states of a contextual CTA
A contextual CTA may change based on the authentication status of the user.

#### CTA required to continue
Use the green alert box component when the user is required to do something before they can continue a process.

#### CTA beneficial, not required

Use the blue informational alert box component when the call to action is beneficial, but not required to proceed.

#### Error
Use a red alert box component when the user is blocked from continuing a process. Always offer at least one way for the user to resolve the error.
