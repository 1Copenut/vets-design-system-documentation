# Signed in vs. signed out
On VA.gov, there are a few differences between the signed in and signed out states:
* [Site header]()
* [Contextual CTAs]()

## Site header
The site header appears globally at the top of every page. Its appearance is responsive to the userâ€™s browser size.
### Large site header
When users sign in, the Sign In button is replaced by a link displays the user's first name. My VA and My Health are also shown as top navigation elements.

**Signed out**

### Small site header
When users are signed into the site on a smaller device, the Sign In link is replaced with the user's first name.

**NOTE**: Not sure this is the best implementation of the Sign In button from an accessibility standpoint. Would be good to get @1Copenut 's take on this.

**Signed out**

## Contextual calls to action
A contextual CTA is used when an action is required or recommended before a user starts a process (like applying for a VA benefit.) Contextual CTAs are placed within a larger chunk of content on a page. Placement depends on its importance compared to other content on the page. Often it is placed immediately after introduction text on a page.

### When is a contextual CTA appropriate?
Use a contextual CTA when:
* The user is required to do something before starting a process
* The user would benefit from doing something before starting a process
* The CTA includes important supplemental information
* An error has occurred and the user is blocked from proceeding

Use the [alert box component]() for contextual CTAs.

### Possible states of a contextual CTA
A contextual CTA may change based on the authentication status of the user.

#### CTA required to continue
Use the green alert box component when the user is required to do something before they can continue a process.

#### CTA beneficial, not required

Use the blue informational alert box component when the call to action is beneficial, but not required to proceed.

#### Error
Use a red alert box component when the user is blocked from continuing a process. Always offer at least one way for the user to resolve the error.
