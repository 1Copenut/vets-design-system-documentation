# Government forms

We often need to talk about or direct people to VA forms and other government forms, such as Department of Defense forms (DD forms). 

## VA forms

When referring to a VA form in the first instance of body copy, lead with the name of the form (preceded by the article "a" or "an," rather than "the"), then the form number in parentheses. [@BETH/DANIELLE - UNCLEAR WHY WE CALL FOR USING A/AN, AND NOT THE.] 

- **Like this:** Fill out an Application for Health Benefits (VA Form 10-10EZ).



On subsequent mentions, refer to it by the VA form number by itself. 

- **Like this:**  You can apply online or fill out and mail an Application for Burial Benefits (VA Form 21P-530). [Download VA Form 21P-530 (PDF)](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21P-530-ARE.pdf)
