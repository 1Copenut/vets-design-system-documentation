# Abbreviations and acronyms

In general, we don't use abbreviations on VA.gov. For acronyms, use the spelled out term on first instance in body copy with the acronym in parentheses; then the acronym alone on subsequent instances. 

- **On first instance:** Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance Traumatic Injury Protection (TSGLI)
- **After first instance:** TSGLI 

If the spelled out term is too long to use for easy scanning in the page title (H1), it's okay to use only the acronym and then define in the first instance of body copy, using the spelled out term with the acronym in parentheses.
