# Abbreviations and acronyms

Common VA acronyms are listed along with other terms on the [word list](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/word-list).

In general, we don't use abbreviations on VA.gov except common cases such as a.m./p.m., titles used before names (Mr., Mrs., Dr., etc.) and degrees (Ph.D., M.D., etc.). When in doubt, follow the AP Style.

For acronyms, use the spelled out term on first mention in body copy with the acronym in parentheses; then the acronym alone on subsequent mentions. 

- **On first mention:** Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance Traumatic Injury Protection (TSGLI)
- **After first mention:** TSGLI 

__Exceptions for page titles and meta title tags__
If the spelled out term is too long for easy scanning in the page title (H1) or to fit within the character count for [meta title tags](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/seo), it's okay to use only the acronym for the page title. Just define it in the first mention in body copy, using the spelled out term with the acronym in parentheses. 
- Note that there may be cases where for SEO purposes or to use the term that Veterans are more familiar with, we might use the spelled out term in page titles.
