# Buttons

Buttons signal important calls-to-action (CTA) and help people quickly see what's the most important action they need to take on a page. Treat buttons like important or primary content, and prioritize their placement on pages as you would essential information. 

For secondary or less important actions on a page, use links instead of buttons. Likewise, for simple navigation to lead people between page, use links instead of buttons.

###Looking for button design and interaction standards?### [Go to button components](../components/buttons.html)  

- Use sentence case for button labels.

- Make button labels as short as possible.

- Use “trigger words” that people recognize and clearly signal what will happen when they click the button.

  ​		**Like this:** Create an account |  **Not like this:** Get started



- Make it an action.

  ​		**Like this:** File a complaint   |   **Not like this:** Complaint filing



- Always take users to the right level of access for the CTA.

  ​		**Like this:** “Explore VA health care” button should take you to a general health care benefits landing page like va.gov/health-care.

  ​		**Like this:** “Apply for VA health care” button should take you to an application page like va.gov/health-care/apply.

  ​		**Like this:** “Compare GI Bill benefits” button should take you right to the comparison tool, va.gov/gi-bill-comparison-tool.
