# Numbers

Use numerals for all numbers, including 1-10. It's easier on the web and on mobile for scanning, and helpful to low-literacy readers and people whose first language isn’t English.

**Exceptions:** 

- Spell out "one" when it's used in the sense of "a" rather than a number that's counting something. 
- Spell out in the expression "more than one." 
- Spell out ordinals up to tenth (first, second, third, etc.). Then use the style: 11th, 12th, etc.

## Percentages

Use numerals and % symbol, with no space between the number and %. This style follows the practice for scientific and technical writing, and differs from 18F. 

We use this approach because it’s easier to scan, and we have a lot of content discussing disability ratings. Disability ratings fall into the scientifc and technical category of writing.
