# Form labels

When adapting a paper form into an online application or tool on VA.gov, content writers and UX designers should consult the [Form label masterlist](https://design.va.gov/patterns/form-labels) to see if a standardized label has already been created. Use the existing standardized labels when building a form rather than create new or custom labels with each new form.

The masterlist documents all form labels and form questions that appear on our online forms. This list is continually updated as more forms are brought online and new field labels and form questions are documented.
