# Bulleted lists

Bulleted lists help make information more scannable and easier to understand.  If a sentence contains more than three items or ideas, we recommend breaking them up into a bulleted list.

- Capitalize the first word of every bullet.
- When using "and" or "or" at the end of each bullet point, bold the "and"/"or" and use a comma before the bolded "and" or "or" at the end of each bullet point.



- Don't use a period at the end of the bullet unless it is a complete sentence.
- Don't use a period at the end of the last bullet in a series of bullets.
- If your list has more than 7 items, use subheads to break out the list into smaller bullet lists.
- Keep list items short (1 or 2 sentences in length).
- Use parallel construction, and consistent style, grammar, and use of punctuation for items in the same list. (Example: each bullet starts with a verb or each bullet is a noun; or each bullet is a fragment; or each bullet is a complete sentence).
- Don't use a bulleted list for only 1 item.
- Punctuation of bullets are determined by list, not by page. It's OK to have a list of bullets that are fragments (donâ€™t use periods) on the same page as a list of bullets that are full sentences (use periods).
