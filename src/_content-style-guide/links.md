# Links

Links should tell people what action to take, where to go next, or what information to expect when they select the link.

- Use natural and descriptive language.
- Hyperlink the most relevant word or phrase.
- Don’t make the link so long that the relevant words get lost.
- Avoid "Click here" as the CTA text.
- Avoid generic CTA links like "Learn more," "See more," and "Read more" by themselves.
- Don't punctuate standalone CTA links. Exception: When the link text is a question.
- If the embedded link text comes at the end of a sentence, don't hyperlink the ending punctuation.
- Don't make links open in a new window. To keep the experience consistent across VA.gov, we code links to behave in the same way.

## Embedded text links vs. CTA links

__Use embedded text links to cross-link related, helpful information__

Embedded text links are hyperlinks that are part of running text in body copy. We use them to link people to related, but not essential, information. 
- Because too many embedded links can be distracting or overwhelming to readers with traumatic brain injuries or other cognitive impairments, we try to not overuse them. 
- Link information when it will be helpful to the Veteran, and it's related to the subject being discussed, not just for the sake of linking. 

__Use CTA links to call out actions__

CTA links are standalone hyperlinks that are calls to an action, but that don't warrant a [primary button CTA](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/button-labels). 

We generally reserve button CTAs to launch an application, to sign in, or other primary, essential action on a page. But there are other kinds of actions that may call for a CTA as a text link, like downloading a form, learning about important information (like eligibility or copay rates, etc.).

__In this example, the link is an action related to the topic, but it isn't the primary CTA which is to use the online application. A standalone CTA text link is an appropriate way to call out this important, but not primary, action.__

## Linking to external sites

On VA.gov we use an icon to alert people that a link will take them to an external site. We don’t use a pop-up or a modal warning. 

- An [icon]({{site.baseurl}}/design/typography#links) is autogenerated whenever there's a full link to an external site, such as `http://example-website.com.`
- **Exception:** We don't use the external linking icon in the VA.gov footer (for example, links to Twitter, Facebook, and other external pages).

Note: The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) does **not** require the use of pop-up notifications for outbound links. See [M-10-23](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-23.pdf) and [M-05-04](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/fy2005/m05-04.pdf) for more information.
