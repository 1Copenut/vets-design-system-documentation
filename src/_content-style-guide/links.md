# Links

Links should tell people what action to take, where to go next, or what information to expect when they select the link. 

- Use natural and descriptive language.
- Hyperlink the most relevant word or phrase. 
- Avoid "Click here," "Learn more," "See more," "Read more," and other generic phrases. 
- Don't punctuate links. Exception: When the link text is a question.
- If the link text comes at the end of a sentence, don't hyperlink the ending punctuation. 
- Don't make links open in a new window. To keep the experience consistent across VA.gov, we code links to behave in the same way.

**Linking to external sites**

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) does **not** require the use of pop-up notifications for outbound links. See [M-10-23](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-23.pdf) and [M-05-04](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/fy2005/m05-04.pdf) for more information. 



**/[Below is from Andy's USCIS guide - I like that this calls for using NATURAL LANGUAGE, rather than 'click x' when possible, and for embedding text links rather than placing on a separate line.]**

Links should be embedded into keywords that clearly identify the information that the link leads to. Links to uscis.gov and other external websites should open in a new tab.

## Linking Conventions

Opt for links set apart from text rather than embedded links. When  possible, place links outside running text, either at the end of a  paragraph or on a separate line following the paragraph. However, it is  ok to embed links when we want to encourage the user to browse to find a  link to a deeper page. PL stresses clarity in general and the use of  calls to action specifically to enhance clarity. With embedded links, it  can sometimes be fuzzy what one would be linking to. With links that  are clear calls to action, it tells the user exactly what they're going  to do when they click the link.

- Use descriptive and actionable words and phrases that tell users  where the link will take them. 
- **Don’t use** the following non-informative,  general link phrases: 
  - Click here
  - Learn more
  - See more
  - Read more

It may make sense to start a link phrase with these words if the rest  of the phrase is specific and descriptive. But you can often do without  these overused words altogether by using more specific verbs or  starting with key words. Above all, be sure your users know what to  expect (where they will land) when they click.

- Pay attention to link length. Make the link long enough that it’s  easy to click on. Don’t make it so long that the relevant words are lost  among the less important words.
  - 5-8 words for embedded links. Don’t link entire sentences in running text.
  - Entire sentences or phrases when the link is set apart from the  running text, either by placing it at the end of a paragraph or by  inserting a space between the running text and the link.
- Don’t link ending punctuation. You don’t want the period to be  underlined. If a string of words at the end of a sentence is linked, use  punctuation (usually a period) as grammar would dictate, but don’t link  it.
- **Don't** code hyperlinks so they open in a new window:  To keep the experience consistent across the entire Vets.gov website, we  code all hyperlinks to behave in the same way.

###  

### External Linking

Vets.gov uses an icon to alert Veterans, without being overly  burdensome, that a link will take them to an external site. We don’t use  a pop-up or a modal warning. This standard practice does not apply to  external links in the vets.gov footer, where no icon accompanies the  links to Twitter, Facebook, and other external pages.

- An icon is autogenerated whenever there is a full link beginning with http, such as: <http://vabenefits.vba.va.gov/vonapp/main.asp>
- No icon will appear when a link is relative (one that begins with a  forward slash followed by the Vets.gov section or page name) and takes  Veterans to an internal vets.gov page, such as: /disability-benefits/conditions/ptsd/.

**Note:** The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) does not require the use of pop-up notifications for outbound links. See [M-10-23](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-23.pdf) and [M-05-04](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/fy2005/m05-04.pdf) for this official guidance.
