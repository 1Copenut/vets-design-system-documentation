# VA.gov Content Style Guide

<div class="va-introtext" markdown="1">
This is our house style guide for the VA.gov website. It's shared across VA agencies and teams, so we can speak with one voice and create a consistent, helpful experience for Veterans and non-Veteran customers. This style guide is a living document and will change over time based on user research and feedback.
</div>

The purpose of this style guide is to help you create better content, not better bureaucracy. See our [content principles](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/vets-design-system-documentation/content-style-guide/content-principles.html).

## What you'll find in this style guide

We've organized the style guide into searchable topics, so you can go directly to the section you need guidance on. This guide covers common issues on VA.gov. It does not cover basic writing mechanics and grammar. (We assume you know those already.)

In general, we follow plain language and web best practices. But where we vary from standard practices, we call them out in the [word list](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/vets-design-system-documentation/content-style-guide/word-list.html) or as a topic section.

**For topics not found in this style guide, refer to:**

- AP Style
- [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](www.merriam-webster.com)
- /?? OPIA style book?? is it linkable or behind intranet? I saw some governance rule we're not supposed to link to intranet??// **@Gary Hicks & Josh Tuscher**
