# Punctuation
We follow standard American English and AP Style on VA.gov. Areas where we differ are listed below.

#### Ampersands

Don't use ampersands (&) in headers or body copy. Spell out “and.” Exceptions are when it's part of a proper noun such as a program name. Example: Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) program.

#### Commas

We use the serial comma, sometimes called the Oxford comma.

- __Like this:__  I like bread, cheese, and wine. / Need a better example here where it really matters.
- __Not this:__  I like bread, cheese and wine. /



#### Contractions

We use contractions on VA.gov. It supports our conversational, person-to-person voice and tone. Some situations might call for spelling out all the words, like in legal or a warning messages, but in general, we prefer using contractions. 

- Be careful not to mix up "its" and "it's."
- Use "it's" as a contraction of "it is," never "it has." 


<div class="do-dont">
<div class="do-dont__do">
<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Like this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">
We're available 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. CT, Monday through Friday. 

</div>
</div>
<div class="do-dont__dont">
<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Not this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">
We are available 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. CT, Monday through Friday.

</div>
</div>
</div>



#### Exclamation points

Don't use the exclamation point on VA.gov for any text elements (body copy, headers, subheaders, field labels, CTAs, etc.). It doesn't align withour voice and tone, which is conversational, helpful, and straightforward. We don't yell, and we're not hyperbolic or casual.

<div class="do-dont">
<div class="do-dont__do">
<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Like this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">
Section header example:
  
__Find out what happens after you apply?__

</div>
</div>
<div class="do-dont__dont">
<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Not this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">
Section header example:
  
__You're enrolled! Now what?__

</div>
</div>
</div>

Note: Some design components may use the exclamation point as an icon for visual accent — in alert components, for example — but don't use it in the message copy itself.



#### Gender-neutral pronouns (they, their)

We use "they" and "their" as gender-neutral pronouns, instead of "he or she" and "his or her."  *The New Fowler's Modern English Language*, third edition, and *Garner's Modern American Usage*, third edition, support this approach.

- __Like this:__  [Add example here]

- __Not this:__  





blah blah

#### blah blah
