# Punctuation
We follow standard American English and AP Style on VA.gov. Areas where we differ are listed below.



#### Bulleted lists

Bulleted lists help organize information into easy to scan, more consumable content.  If a sentence lists more than three items or ideas, we recommend breaking them up into a bulleted list.

- Capitalize the first word of every bullet.
- Use a comma before the bolded "and" or "or" at the end of the line of text for each bullet.
- Don't use a period at the end of the bullet unless it is a complete sentence. __[@BETH, DANIELLE - What is the current Vets.gov style when the list is a mix of complete sentences and fragments? Old school style is to use period on every bullet list item, if one is a complete sentence, but I don't know if this is what we do. EX: on the health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments, we have bullet lists that are complete sentences but none of them have periods.]__
- Don't use a period at the end of the last bullet in a series of bullets.
- If your list has more than 7 items, use subheads to break out the list into smaller bullet lists.
- Keep list items short (1 or 2 sentences in length).
- Use parallel construction, and consistent style, grammar, and use of punctuation for items in the same list. (Example: each bullet starts with a verb or each bullet is a noun; or each bullet is a fragment; or each bullet is a complete sentence).
- Don't use a bulleted list for only 1 item.



#### Commas

We use the serial comma, sometimes called the Oxford comma.

- __Like this:__  I like bread, cheese, and wine. / Need a better example here where it really matters.
- __Not this:__  I like bread, cheese and wine. /



#### Contractions

We use contractions on VA.gov. It supports our conversational, person-to-person voice and tone. Some situations might call for spelling out all the words, like in legal or a warning messages, but in general, we prefer using contractions. 

- Be careful not to mix up "its" and "it's."
- Use "it's" as a contraction of "it is," never "it has."

<div class="do-dont__do">
<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Like this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">
We're available 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. CT, Monday through Friday.

#### Exclamation points

Don't use the exclamation point on VA.gov for any text elements (body copy, headers, subheaders, field labels, CTAs, etc.). It doesn't align withour voice and tone, which is conversational, helpful, and straightforward. We don't yell, and we're not hyperbolic or casual.

<div class="do-dont">
<div class="do-dont__do">
<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Like this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">
Section header example:
  
__Find out what happens after you apply?__

</div>
</div>
<div class="do-dont__dont">
<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Not this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">
Section header example:
  
__I'm enrolled! Now what?__

</div>
</div>
</div>

Note: Some design components may use the exclamation point as an icon for visual accent — in alert components, for example — but don't use it in the message copy itself.



#### Gender-neutral pronouns (they, their)

We use "they" and "their" as gender-neutral pronouns, instead of "he or she" and "his or her."  *The New Fowler's Modern English Language*, third edition, and *Garner's Modern American Usage*, third edition, support this approach.

- __Like this:__  [Add example here]

- __Not this:__  





blah blah

#### blah blah
