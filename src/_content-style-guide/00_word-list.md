# Word list

For most terms on VA.gov, we use the standard American English spelling in Merriam-Webster Dictionary. The words on this list are exceptions or need clarification.

- We might use different capitalization or hyphenation.
- We may call for using a more plain language version of a word or to define it in body copy.  
- We may call for using a preferred version on VA.gov when different VA agencies use variations for the same word.

For terms that are not on this list, refer to [Merriam-Webster](www.merriam-webster.com).

### A

- active duty: Hyphenate when it modifies a noun; do not capitalize. Example: active-duty service member.
- accredited representative: Lowercase, and define on first appropriate instance as "a trained professional trusted to help with VA-related claims." Include the definition in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas. Example:  "Get help from an accredited representative, a trained professional trusted to help with VA-related claims."
- advanced: Capitalize only when used as part of the branded term "My HealtheVet Advanced." Otherwise lowercase.
- Agent Orange: Define term on first mention in body copy as "a toxic chemical used to clear trees and plants during the war." Include the definition in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas.
- annual: Unless part of a benefit or program name, avoid the use of terms like "annual," "biannual," and "biennial," and opt for plain language alternatives instead. For example, use "each year" or "once each year" (instead of "annual"), "2 times each year" or "twice each year" (instead of "bi-annual"), and "every other year" (instead of "biennial"). **[@Beth, Danielle - is "annual" really actually difficult for our customers to understand? Annual, annually -- these seem pretty common and easy to understand. (As opposed to terms like bi-annual, bi-weekly, bi-monthly which might be confused between 'twice per' or 'every other.'' ) - ***[Danielle response: Wherever possible, we aim to use the simplest word option with the fewest syllables and clearest meaning. So even though "annual" is pretty well understood, "each year" is even simpler. And with this specific example, avoiding "annual" helps to get the writer in the practice to also avoid the more confusing "biannual" and "biennial."]***
- apply: Use "file a claim for disability compensation" instead of "apply for benefits." "Apply" is okay for other benefits, such as "Apply for VA health care." ***[Danielle note: Added that "Apply" is okay for other benefits to ensure clarity.]***
- Armed Forces: Capitalize.
- asbestos: Define on first mention in body copy as "toxic fibers, once used in many buildings and products." Include the definition in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas.
- attending physician: Define on first mention in body copy, in the context of life insurance, as "the doctor in charge of your care" (when talking the Veteran) or "the doctor in charge of a Veteran's care" (when talking to a family caregiver). Include the definition in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas. ***[Danielle note: Revised for clarity]***

### B

- basic: Capitalize only when used as part of the branded term "DS Logon Basic." Otherwise lowercase.
- became ill: Use "got sick."
- became worse: Use "got worse."
- beneficiary: In the context of life insurance, define this term as "the person you choose to receive your insurance proceeds" on first reference in body copy. Include the definition in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas. ***[Updated per live site hub page copy.]*** 
- Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program: Note that “Benefits” is plural. ***[Danielle question: Pull out into the acronyms list instead?]***
- blind or low-vision (not "blind or sight-impaired")

### C

- can vs. may: Use "can" when meaning the ability or power to do something; use "may" when meaning the permission to do it.
- caregiver: Use "caregiver" (not "caretaker"). Also note that family members do not necessarily see themselves as "caregivers" so, while "family caregiver" can be used as a shorthand term, wherever possible use a more descriptive phrase such as "family member caring for a Veteran with disabilities" instead. ***[Danielle note: Added more context around family caregivers.]***
[***Danielle note: Removed the reference to DD214 here since it's covered in the forms section]***
- certifying official: Use this term to refer to the person at one's school who needs to approve/submit enrollment information for VA education benefits. Example: "Your school’s certifying official will submit your enrollment information with a VA Enrollment Certification (VA Form 22-1999)." ***[Danielle note: Added more context and an example]***

- chronic: Define on first mention in body copy as "long-lasting" or when needed, "illness that lasts for a long time." Include the definition in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas.
- claim exam: This is a term VA is working to rebrand. For now, on first mention on a page, use "VA claim exam (also known as a compensation and pension, or C&P, exam)". After first mention, use "VA claim exam" or "claim exam." ***[Danielle note: Added some context around this evolving term.]***
- click: Avoid using, especially "click here." Link the relevant words instead. Example: “Find an [accredited representative](https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/apply-for-benefits/help/index.html) to help you.”  
  - click: Avoid "click here" for embedded text links. Link the relevant words instead.  [See also Links](hyperlink-to-Links-topic)
  - Example: Find an [accredited representative](https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/apply-for-benefits/help/index.html) to help you. **[@Jared: can we format these words like link but not have it be dead link?]**

  - ​	[**@Beth, Danielle - Yes avoid for "click here," but I think it's okay, and prefereable for clarity, to use "click" in interface copy such as instructing people to click a particular CTA button - ex: "In Google Calendar, click **Create.**" or "Click **Profile** in your account dashboard." **Thoughts? See also Links[@ME:ADDLINKTO LINKS SECTION OF STYLE GUIDE]** ***Danielle response: Yes, agree 100%. We use "click" in that context now, so I think it's good to add the explicit exception here. I do wonder if we should talk with Trevor about any accessibility concerns around the word "click" as we did for "press"?]***
- compensation: "Disability compensation" is the preferred term, but "VA disability pay" has greater SEO value and is more plain language. Use "VA disability compensation (pay)" on first mention, and try to work in both terms. Also include explanation of "monthly payments." ***[Danielle note: Revised more based on more recent SME guidance and SEO research]***
- competent: Define on first mention in body copy as "of legal age and sound mind." Include the definition in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas.
- conditions: Define on first mention as "illnesses or injuries (also known as conditions)." For all other mentions, "condition" or "conditions" is OK.
- contamination: Define on first mention in body copy as "water that was found to have toxic chemicals in it." Include the definition in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas. **Exception:** On the Camp Lejeune page, don't define this term.

- dentistry: Use "dental care" instead.
- Department of Veterans Affairs: Spell out in its entirety (no apostrophe on Veterans') or shorten to "Veterans Affairs" or "VA." Do not use "DVA," "Dept of VA," or other shortened versions. ***[Danielle note: Added more specific guidance per JL; Jen, can you double check to make sure this is accurate? Thanks!]***
- Dependents’ Educational Assistance Program: Refer to this as "Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) program." Include "also called Chapter 35" on first mention. Can be shortened to "DEA program" after first mention. ***[Danielle note: Revised per live site copy.]***
***[Danielle note: Removed "dependents of Veterans" entry; confirmed w/ Beth it's not needed here]***
- deprivation: Define one first mention in body copy as "a lack of things such as sleep that people need for their physical and mental well being." Include the definition in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas.
- decision notice: Do not refer to as "decision letter." The Veteran undergoes a VA claim exam (referred to as a C&P exam by Veterans), and then after VA reviews the evidence, we send a "decision notice" that includes the disability rating.
- disability rating: Define as "a rating that measures how severe a disability is" or similar language. For example:

  - educational counseling
    - educational and career counseling (this instance runs counter to the style within eBenefits > Apply > Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Benefits > Education and Career Counseling, but aligns with VR&E Chapter 36 (Educational and Vocational Counseling)
    - educational and vocational counseling (to be consistent with VR&E Chapter 36: Educational and Vocational Counseling)
  - educational institution

- equivalent: Use an alternative word or phrase, depending on context. For example:
  - Use "Apply for VA health care online (Equal to VA Form 10-10EZ)" instead of "Apply for VA health care online (Equivalent to VA Form 10-10EZ)".
  - Use "We'll also review your discharge papers (DD214 or other separation documents)" instead of "We'll also review your discharge papers (DD214 or equivalent)" ***[Danielle note: Revised for greater nuance]***
- era: Uppercase for Vietnam Era (this is a VA term). If you need to talk about the Vietnam War, which has different dates associated with it than Vietnam Era, style it with "era" lowercase: Vietnam War era. **[@Beth/Danielle - what is Ic:? Can we use something more plain language? / jl]** ***[Danielle response: This was just shorthand for "lowercase" - have spelled it out.]***
- evidence: Define as "supporting documents" and add, "like a doctor's report or medical test results," as needed.
- exception: Used to call special attention to something. It should be bolded and never in all caps. **[@Beth/Danielle: could you point out for me example on site? Not sure calling for it to be bolded would always be good...? / jl]** ***[Danielle response: See the blue box on this page for an example: https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/study-at-foreign-schools/.]***
- excluding: Use "not counting" or "not including."
- expedite/expedited: Use words like "faster," "quicker," or "speed up," depending on context. For example:
  - Use "Find out how to use the Fully Developed Claims program to get a faster decision on your disability benefits claim" instead of "Find out how to use the Fully Developed Claims program to get an expedited decision on your disability benefits claim"
  - Use "This may help speed up the claim decision process so you can get your benefits sooner" instead of "This may help expedite the claim decision process." **[@Beth, Danielle - is this guideline specific only to "faster"? Couldn't there be a situation where other plain language phrases might work better or just as well -- more quickly, quicker -- or are we strictly calling for "faster" for consistency?]** ***[Danielle response: Agree, I think there are different ways we can get around using "expedite/expedited." I've added some nuance and examples.]***
- explosive ordinance: Define on first mention in body copy as "high-explosive devices, and chemical and nuclear weapons." Include definition as another sentence, a parenthetical, or set off with commas.

Include definition in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas.  **[@Beth, Danielle - could you provide background on this?

I've revised to add more context.]***

- guaranty: Should be used only as a noun. “Because of our partial guaranty, lenders may offer better loan terms for Veterans.”
- Guardsman/Guardsmen: Replace with gender neutral language. For now, use "Guard member." In the process of confirming guidance. ***[Danielle note: Updated to reflect gender neutral terminology]***

- Prisoner of War: Capitalized to match the 10-10EZ. **[ [DOD military dictionary does NOT capitalize this term](https://www.militaryfactory.com/dictionary/military-terms-defined.asp?term_id=4243). Therefore, I recommend using the same standard American English lowercase, _except_ when it is part of a proper noun such as the name of a form or law, like the "Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War."]** ***[Danielle note: Agree, and would just add that we usually include "POW" as in "prisoner of war (POW)"]***

- Project 112/SHAD

- process (a claim): Use "review." **Example:** "We'll review your disability claim."

- prove: Avoid the word "prove" when speaking to evidence a Veteran needs to provide for a claim. Instead, use more empathetic language such as "show" or "to support your claim."

- PTSD: posttraumatic stress disorder (no hyphen) **[@Beth, Danielle, Working Group -- would like to know how other agencies, particularly medical centers, use this term. MW uses the hyphen "post-traumatic stress disorder," which seems more common to me, and is actually easier to scan. Also, what is our current usage -- do we always spell it out in body copy, first instance only, do we use acronym, then spelling, or vice versa; or is this acronym considered common enough that we omit spelled term?]** ***[Danielle response: For history - I believe we follow this style in order to align with the National Center for PTSD. Re: the question of usage - we currently use "PTSD" in the left nav. We use "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)" in the page title and first mention in body copy of the PTSD health care page (for SEO purposes), and then PTSD after first mention in body copy]***

- TSGLI: Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance Traumatic Injury Protection **[@Beth, Danielle, Working Group - I'm confused - where is the T in TSGLI? Also, this seems the same as entry under "S" -- are we saying always use the acronym first? Why do we list this twice? ]** ***[Danielle response: The "T" is for "Traumatic," though I'm not sure why it's at the beginning of the acronym rather than it being "SGLITIP"...my assumption is it was just a shorter acronym to go with, and we just aligned with existing acronym for it. I also wonder if this should be moved to the acronym part of the guide?]***

### U

- U.S.: Use periods.

### V

- VA: Don't insert "the" before VA when it is used as a noun. However, when VA serves as an adjective, do use the article. For example: "The VA task force announced today...." In full, the Department of Veterans Affairs.

- > The following is taken from the [VHA Style and Usage](https://vaww.va.gov/webcom/style.asp) page. **@Working group, Editorial - let's discuss** whether this belongs in the word list or whether it warrants its own section in the style guide. This info seems rather bulky for a word list entry; but we can also consider streamlining this for VA.gov, since it's not clear that all of this is relevant for the website - **for instance, on VA.gov, we DON'T put VA inside parentheses, since the global header prominently shows the official logo with VA | and the full spelled out U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.** Since this header appears on every page on VA.gov, it would be redundant to put "(VA)" in body copy, even on first reference.  
  >
  > References to Department of Veterans Affairs
  >  The full title is the “Department of Veterans Affairs” (no apostrophe).
  >  It should be used whenever a first reference to the department is made.
  >  The abbreviation “VA” (not DVA) should be put in parentheses.
  >  Subsequent references can be either to “the department” or “VA.”
  >  Sometimes, VA may need to be distinguished from a state’s Department of Veterans Affairs.
  > In that case, the full title can be “U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.”
  >  Do not use “the” before the abbreviation when it is used as a noun. For example: “VA announced today that....” If VA is used as an adjective, then “the” will be used in front of “VA” where appropriate. For example: “The VA task force announced today that ....” vs. "Some VA facilities and services in Texas are affected by Hurricane Florence."**[@working group, @beth & danielle - for web, especially in components where space is an issue such as banner alerts, I think we should omit article for phrases such as "VA medical centers" and "VA services/facilities." In these instances, VA is part of a compound noun, rather than as an adjective, no? EX: Some VA facilities and services in TX are affected by Hurricane Florence.]** ***Danielle note: Yes, agree 100%. Worked in proposed revision above.***

- VA.gov: Treat it as a brand name and always capitalize the "VA." Omit https://www .

  ​	**Do:** Preview the new VA.gov.

  ​	**Don't:** Va.gov has benefits information for Veterans.

- VA health care facility

- VA medical center: Don't shorten to VA center. "Medical Center" should be capitalized only if a specific medical center name is included in the title (example: "Washington VA Medical Center").

- VA national cemetery: "national cemetery" is lowercase except when part of the full name of a cemetery. ***[Danielle note: Added since we have an entry for "Veterans cemetery"]***

- VA regional office: Use "VA regional office" and not "VA regional benefits office." "Regional Office" should only be capitalized if a specific name is included in the title.

- vesicant agents: Use "vesicant (blistering) agents."

- Vet Center: Capitalize "Center."

- Veteran: On VA.gov, capitalize even when used as a common noun. When possible, you can avoid this awkward style by recasting sentences into a more conversational tone and speaking directly with Veterans, rather than referring to them in the third person.

  ​	**Okay:** Learn about services and benefits that we offer to Veterans and their families.

  ​	**Better:** Learn about VA services and benefits that you and your family may be eligible for.

- Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) ***[Danielle question: Remove here and pull this into terms/acronyms list?]***

- Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) ***[Danielle question: Remove here and pull this into terms/acronyms list?]***

- Veterans cemetery: "Veterans" does not take an apostrophe, and "cemetery" is lowercase except when part of the full name of a cemetery.

  ​	**Examples:**

  - Family members may be eligible if they're buried in a Veterans cemetery.
  - The Hawaii State Veterans Cemetery is located in Kaneohe, HI.

- Veterans Crisis Line: Note that "Veterans" does not take an apostrophe. **[@Beth, Danielle - the ph# was in parens, but did you intend to convey that the # should always appear in parens after the text? or did you just want the correct ph# to be available and listed here in the entry? What happens if the ph# changes without our team's knowledge? Maybe we should include a list of the most essential VA phone numbers that we reference on our site?]** ***[Danielle response: I think it's a good idea to pull out phone numbers as a separate section. Always good to have one place for numbers/rates that may be updated so we only need to update in one place. I've removed the number here.]***

- Veterans Employment Center™ (VEC) **[@Beth, Daniell, Working Group: do we have guidelines on the use of trademarks? e.g., use the symbol on first use only or on every instance or in headlines only or never in headlines/only in body copy...? Is there a place to link to?]** ***[Danielle note: We have, in the past, only added trademarks when specifically directed to be SMEs. Legal guidance for GI Bill trademark, for example, was to add once in the most prominent mention on the site (which we determined was the Education and Training hub page).]***

- Veterans’ Mortgage Life Insurance (VMLI): Takes a plural possessive apostrophe—Veterans'. ***[Danielle question: Remove here and pull this into terms/acronyms list?]***

- Vietnam Era: Uppercase "era," but "Vietnam War era" (lowercase "era"). Mostly we use the first term: Vietnam Era.

### W

- website: One word, not capitalized.
- work study: Two words, not hyphenated as a noun; hyphenate when used as an adjective preceding a noun. **[@Beth, Danielle - can you provide example on VA.gov? And would we really use for example, hyphenated, "work-study program"? This seems really really arcane, versus simply using the phrase as a compound adjective -- work study program.]** ***[Danielle note: Here's an example - "Find out if you can earn money while you go to school through our work-study program." Beth, Randi - Can you address this one in terms of copy editing?]***

### X

### Y

- Yellow Ribbon Scholarship (Yellow Ribbon Program): Capitalize “Program.”
