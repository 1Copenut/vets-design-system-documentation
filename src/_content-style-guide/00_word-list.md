# Word list

For most terms on VA.gov, we use the standard American English spelling in Merriam-Webster Dictionary. The words on this list are exceptions or need clarification.

- We might use different capitalization or hyphenation.
- We may call for using a more plain language version of a word or to define it in body copy.  
- We may call for using a preferred version on VA.gov when different VA agencies use variations for the same word.

For terms that are not on this list, refer to [Merriam-Webster](www.merriam-webster.com).

### A

- active duty: Hyphenate when it modifies a noun; do not capitalize. Example: active-duty service member.

- deprivation: Define in body copy as "a lack of things such as sleep that people need for their physical and mental well being." Include the definition in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas.

    - educational and vocational counseling (to be consistent with VR&E Chapter 36: Educational and Vocational Counseling)
  - educational institution
  - educational plan
  - educational program

- era: Uppercase for Vietnam Era (this is a VA term). If you need to talk about the Vietnam War, which has different dates associated with it than Vietnam Era, style it with "era" lc: Vietnam War era. **[@Beth/Danielle - what is Ic:? Can we use something more plain language? / jl]**
- evidence: Define as "supporting documents" and add, "like a doctor's report or medical test results," as needed.

- excluding: Use "not counting" or "not including."
- expedited: Use "faster." **[@Beth, Danielle - is this guideline specific only to "faster"? Couldn't there be a situation where other plain language phrases might work better or just as well -- more quickly, quicker -- or are we strictly calling for "faster" for consistency?]**
- explosive ordinance: Defined as high-explosive devices, and chemical and nuclear weapons. **[@Beth, Danielle - is entry telling ppl to define phrase like this in body copy? or it's just defining for us internally?]**

- final status: Use “in final status” rather than “in a final status."

### G

- GI: No periods (*not* G.I.).
- GI Bill Comparison Tool: Capitalize "Comparison Tool."
- gravesite: Style this as one word. (Merriam-Webster does not address whether this should be one or two words, but the Gravesite Locator and Arlington National Cemetery both style it as one word.

### H

- hazardous: use "harmful" or "toxic."
- hazardous exposure: defined as contact with harmful chemicals or other hazardous materials.

- health problems: Use "illnesses and injuries (also known as conditions)." **[@Beth, Danielle - pls cf entry on "physical or mental disorder" which calls for defining it as a "health problem...." Not sure I uderstand rationale of avoiding "health problem" phrase in some instances.]**
- hospitalization: Use "hospital care."
- home loan: Do not use a hyphen when in the form of an adjective. ("home loan benefits").
- Homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.

### I

- illness: Use "illness" to refer to diseases.

### M

- manufacturing: Use "making."

- may: See entry for "can."
- Military Occupation Code (MOC)
- Million Veteran Program (MVP)
- MISSION Act: Refer to it by the official short title, VA MISSION Act. (The full name of the bill is the "John S. McCain III, Daniel K. Akaka, and Samuel R. Johnson VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018.")

- new claim: A claim for added benefits or other benefit requests related to an existing service-connected disability. **[@Beth, Danielle - I think I added this from one of the VA.gov pages you worked on which listed definitions for a bunch of different kinds of claims. Should we include them in the Word list? maybe it's not relevant if we are not calling for these terms to be defined as such in body copy. Other terms from that page -- original claim, secondary claim, reopened claim...]**

- Persian Gulf War era: Lowercase "era."

- physical or mental disorder: defined as a health problem that affects the body or mind. **[@Beth, Danielle - is this entry saying to define this phrase as "health problem that affects..."? Also, cf entry on "health problem," which says to use "illnesses and injuries (also known as conditions)" - so this would really be... illness (also known as a condition) that affects the body or mind"?? ]**

- Prisoner of War: Capitalized to match the 10-10EZ. **[ [DOD military dictionary does NOT capitalize this term](https://www.militaryfactory.com/dictionary/military-terms-defined.asp?term_id=4243).

- PTSD: posttraumatic stress disorder (no hyphen) **[@Beth, Danielle, Working Group -- would like to know how other agencies, particularly medical centers, use this term. MW uses the hyphen "post-traumatic stress disorder," which seems more common to me, and is actually easier to scan. Also, what is our current usage -- do we always spell it out in body copy, first instance only, do we use acronym, then spelling, or vice versa; or is this acronym considered common enough that we omit spelled term?]**

### Q

- Selected Reserve  **[@Beth, Danielle - what does this entry mean?]**

- service-connected condition: Define in body copy as an "illness or injury caused—or made worse by— active-duty service." Can define in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas.

  - Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance Disability Extension (SGLI-DE)
  - Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance Traumatic Injury Protection (TSGLI): Branded term.  **[@Beth, Danielle - not sure what this entry is advising.

- survivors: Use "qualified survivors."

- Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance program (also called Dependents’ Educational Assistance program).

- TSGLI: Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance Traumatic Injury Protection **[@Beth, Danielle, Working Group - I'm confused - where is the T in TSGLI? Also, this seems the same as entry under "S" -- are we saying always use the acronym first? Why do we list this twice? ]**

### U

- U.S.: Use periods.

### V

- VA: Don't insert "the" before VA when it is used as a noun. However, when VA serves as an adjective, do use the article. For example: "The VA task force announced today...." In full, the Department of Veterans Affairs.

- > The following is taken from the [VHA Style and Usage](https://vaww.va.gov/webcom/style.asp) page. **@Working group, Editorial - let's discuss** whether this belongs in the word list or whether it warrants its own section in the style guide. This info seems rather bulky for a word list entry; but we can also consider streamlining this for VA.gov, since it's not clear that all of this is relevant for the website - **for instance, on VA.gov, we DON'T put VA inside parentheses, since the global header prominently shows the official logo with VA | and the full spelled out U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.** Since this header appears on every page on VA.gov, it would be redundant to put "(VA)" in body copy, even on first reference.  
  >
  > References to Department of Veterans Affairs
  >  The full title is the “Department of Veterans Affairs” (no apostrophe).
  >  It should be used whenever a first reference to the department is made.
  >  The abbreviation “VA” (not DVA) should be put in parentheses.
  >  Subsequent references can be either to “the department” or “VA.”
  >  Sometimes, VA may need to be distinguished from a state’s Department of Veterans Affairs.
  > In that case, the full title can be “U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.”
  >  Do not use “the” before the abbreviation when it is used as a noun. For example: “VA announced today that....” If VA is used as an adjective, then “the” will be used in front of “VA.” For example: “The VA task force announced today that ....” **[@working group, @beth & danielle - for web, especially in components where space is an issue such as banner alerts, I think we should omit article for phrases such as "VA medical centers" and "VA services/facilities." In these instances, VA is part of a compound noun, rather than as an adjective, no? EX: Some VA facilities and services in TX are affected by Hurricane Florence.]**

- VA.gov: Treat it as a brand name and always capitalize the "VA." Omit https://www .

  ​	**Do:** Preview the new VA.gov.

  ​	**Don't:** Va.gov has benefits information for Veterans.

- VA health care facility

- VA medical center: Don't shorten to VA center. "Medical Center" should be capitalized only if a specific medical center name is included in the title (example: Washington VA Medical Center).

- VA regional office: "Regional Office" should only be capitalized if a specific name is included in the title.

- vesicant agents: Use "vesicant (blistering) agents."

- Vet Center: Capitalize "Center."

- Veteran: On VA.gov, capitalize even when used as a common noun. When possible, you can avoid this awkward style by recasting sentences into a more conversational tone and speaking directly with Veterans, rather than referring to them in the third person.

  ​	**Okay:** Learn about services and benefits that we offer to Veterans and their families.

  ​	**Better:** Learn about VA services and benefits that you and your family may be eligible for.

- Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC)

- Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA)

- Veterans cemetery: "Veterans" does not take an apostrophe, and "cemetery" is lowercase except when part of the full name of a cemetery.

  ​	**Examples:**

  - Family members may be eligible if they're buried in a Veterans cemetery.
  - The Hawaii State Veterans Cemetery is located in Kaneohe, HI.

- Veterans Crisis Line: "Veterans" does not take an apostrophe. The phone number is 1-800-273-8255. **[@Beth, Danielle - the ph# was in parens, but did you intend to convey that the # should always appear in parens after the text? or did you just want the correct ph# to be available and listed here in the entry? What happens if the ph# changes without our team's knowledge? Maybe we should include a list of the most essential VA phone numbers that we reference on our site?]**

- Veterans Employment Center™ (VEC) **[@Beth, Daniell, Working Group: do we have guidelines on the use of trademarks? e.g., use the symbol on first use only or on every instance or in headlines only or never in headlines/only in body copy...? Is there a place to link to?]**

- Veterans Health Administration (VHA)

- Veterans Job Bank: "Veterans" is plural.

- Veterans Service Organization (VSO): "Veterans" is plural.

- Veterans Service Representative (VSR): “Veterans” is plural.

- Veterans’ Educational Assistance Program (VEAP): Takes a plural possessive apostrophe—Veterans'.

- Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI): Takes a plural possessive apostrophe—Veterans'.

- Veterans’ Mortgage Life Insurance (VMLI): Takes a plural possessive apostrophe—Veterans'.

- Vietnam Era: Uppercase "era," but "Vietnam War era" (lowercase "era"). Mostly we use the first term: Vietnam Era.

### W

- website: One word, not capitalized.
- work study: Two words, not hyphenated as a noun; hyphenate when usedas an adjective preceding a noun. **[@Beth, Danielle - can you provide example on VA.gov? And would we really use for example, hyphenated, "work-study program"? This seems really really arcane, versus simply using the phrase as a compound adjective -- work study program.]**

### X

### Y

- Yellow Ribbon Scholarship (Yellow Ribbon Program): Capitalize “Program.”

### Z

- zip code: Lowercase, two words.
