# Naming

Most tools, products, benefits, offices, and programs don’t need a brand name. Don’t create new branded names (official or otherwise) because:

-	Branded terms often introduce internal jargon that Veteran customers aren’t familiar with. 
-	Branded terms—[like logos](https://design.va.gov/design/logos) that are different from the official VA brand—spawn unnecessary sub-brands that create confusion for users. 
-	Veterans need to be "educated" on the meaning of new branded terms, which is both expensive and time-consuming to do. 


### Use descriptive plain language labels

If you need to call your tool, product, feature, or program something, call it what it is. Use everyday, plain language words that people already understand.

This follows our [content principles](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/content-principles), is easier to understand without explanatory information, and is better for [SEO](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/seo).

### Don't create acronyms to use like a brand name

Don’t create new [acronyms](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/abbreviations-and-acronyms) in Veteran-facing content that aren't already commonly used and understood. When in doubt, refer to [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com) or AP Style.

**Avoid “alphabet soup” syndrome**

When we transform common words into capitalized, branded terms, and then refer to them as acronyms, we needlessly force internal jargon on our customers. Internal acronyms used like branded or official names:
- Are hard to understand by customers and people outside your business or team.
-	Sound like Government, not human.
-	Don’t align with the clear, helpful, and plain language part of our content principles.
-	Aren't person-to-person, conversational, and empathetic in voice and tone.

In certain cases, our Veterans transportation program may reimburse you for the cost of traveling to a VA medical center out of your area. We also give grants to organizations that provide transportation services to Veterans living in very rural areas, and can help arrange transportation for special needs.
