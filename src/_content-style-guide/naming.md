# Naming

Just as is mentioned in the [Logos](https://design.va.gov/design/logos) section of the VA.gov Design System, user research shows that Veterans find multiple brands confusing and complicated to understand. The simpler, the better. This is also true for writing about products, tools, offices or programs. 

## Use plain language

Use a plain language description when talking about products, tools and programs. These are the everyday words people know and understand. These are also the words we use when doing internet searches, making plain language essential for [SEO](http://dev-design.va.gov.s3-website-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/content-style-guide/seo) purposes.

## Avoid using acronyms 
Avoid using [acronyms](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/abbreviations-and-acronyms) that aren't established or already known to Veterans. It is clearer to use descriptive language than to brand the product, tool or program as an acronym.
