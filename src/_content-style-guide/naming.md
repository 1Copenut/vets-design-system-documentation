# Naming

Just as is mentioned in the [Logos](https://design.va.gov/design/logos) section of the VA.gov Design System, user research shows that Veterans find multiple brands confusing and complicated to understand. The simpler, the better. This is also true for writing about products, tools, offices or programs. 

VA already uses many established terms such as "National Call to Service program," "Post-9/11 GI Bill," and "Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment," just to name a few. Use a plain language description instead of making Veterans learn a new term they don't need or cluttering the page with unnecessary capitalized brands. By writing in this way, we follow our [content principles](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/content-principles), creating "consistent, clear, and customer-centered content." 

Avoid using [acronyms](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/abbreviations-and-acronyms) that aren't established or already known to Veterans. It's clearer to use descriptive language when explaining what the product is or what the tool does than to brand it as an acronym. 

Writing in plain language uses everyday words people know and understand. These are also the words we use when doing internet searches. Describing programs and tools in this way is essential for SEO purposes. Simply tell the reader what your product does. There's no need to make up a new brand.
