# Capitalization

@ content team - let's discuss simplifying the capitalization styles used on va.gov. Would like to use sentence case for everything except proper nouns (including VA branded names, form names, so on ) and certain special VA terms like "Veterans."

Currently, we appear to use...

- page titles and headers - title case 
- subheads - sentence case sometimes, but title case other times
- stand alone text links - sentence case sometimes, title case sometimes
- nav links (which sometimes is the same label as stand alone text links -- like from homepage hubs) - title case
- breadcrumb labels - title case
- alert banner titles - sentence case
