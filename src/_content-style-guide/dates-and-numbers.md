# Dates, times, and phone numbers

Dates, times, and phone numbers often appear together, so we've put guidelines for these in one place.

## Dates and years

Spell out dates in body copy, using the full construction: March 31, 1989. In general, spell out days of the week and months also in body copy. 

__Exceptions:__

- Use 9/11 when it's part of a program name such as the Post-9/11 GI Bill.
- Abbreviate days and months when space is very limited, such as in callout boxes, alerts, or promo components, etc.
  - Mon., Tue., Wed., Thu., Fri., Sat., Sun.
  - Jan., Feb., Mar., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., Dec. (Don't abbreviate May, June, July.)
  - In application form fields, we often use the construction: mm/dd/yyyy
<br>

__Years__

When referencing decades or periods of years, don't use an apostrophe with the "s."

- **Like this:** The early 2000s
- **Not this:** The early 2000's

## Times and time zones

Write out times, using a.m. and p.m. with periods: 9:00 a.m.

- Spell out noon and midnight. Don't use 12:00 p.m. or 12:00 a.m.
- Include the minutes, even when on-the-hour.

</div>
</div>
</div>
- Include time zones as CT, ET, MT, or PT (no parentheses, periods, or daylight/standard).
- When referencing international time zones, use the time zone name for that country or the UTC (coordinated universal time) offset. (Example: Central European Time; Korea Standard Time; UTC +2)

- In body copy, write out ranges using sentence construction: We're open 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. MT, Monday through Friday.
- Where space is limited, indicate ranges with the – en dash (not the shorter - hyphen) and a space on either side. Don't combine the en dash with from/between sentence construction.

## Phone numbers 

Use hyphens between numbers, and don't use parentheses to set off the area code: 212-123-1234

- Use +1 only when the information is specifically addressing Veterans or people who are living outside the U.S.: +1-201-123-1234.

- For vanity phone numbers, provide the numerals in parentheses at the end: 877-222-VETS (8387).

- For phone numbers with an extension, use ext. at the end: 202-123-1234, ext. 9.

- Use "select" to indicate the menu option after dialing a phone number.
