# Dates, times, and phone numbers

__Dates__

Spell out dates in body copy, using the full construction: March 31, 1989. In general, spell out days of the week and months also in body copy.  

__Exceptions__

- Use 9/11 when referencing the September 11, 2001, terror attack.
- Abbreviate days and months when space is very limited, such as in callout boxes, alerts, or promo components, etc.
  - Mon., Tue., Wed., Thu., Fri., Sat., Sun.
  - Jan., Feb., Mar., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., Dec. (Don't abbreviate May, June, July.)
  - In application form fields, we often use mm/dd/yyyy construction.

__Times and time zones__

Write out times, using a.m. and p.m. with periods: 9:00 a.m.

-  Spell out noon and midnight. Don't use 12:00 p.m. or 12:00 a.m.
- Include the minutes, even when on-the-hour.
  - __Do:__ 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. ET    
  - __Don't:__ 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. ET  
- Include time zones as CT, ET, MT, or PT (no parentheses, periods, or daylight/standard). __([NOTE:vha doesn’t use (paren) – part of timestamp; vba does; ])__
- When referencing international time zones, use the time zone name for that country or the UTC (coordinated universal time) offset. (Example: Central European Time; Korea Standard Time; UTC +2)

- In body copy, write out ranges using sentence construction: We're open 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.
- Where space is limited, indicate ranges with the – en dash (not the shorter - hyphen) and a space on either side. Don't combine the en dash with from/between ​sentence construction.
  - __Do:__ 8:00 a.m. – noon CT
  - __Don't:__ from 8:00 a.m. – noon CT

__Phone numbers__

Use hyphens between numbers, and don't use parentheses to set off the area code: 212-123-1234

- Use +1 only when the information is specifically addressing Veterans or people who are living outside the U.S.: +1-201-123-1234.

- For vanity phone numbers, provide the numerals in parentheses at the end: 877-222-VETS (8387).

- For phone numbers with an extension, use ext. at the end: 202-123-1234, ext. 9.

- Use "select" or "press" to indicate the menu option after dialing a phone number. Both of these terms are considered 508 compliant.
  - __Example:__ Call us toll free at 800-123-1234, then select 2, from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. CT.
