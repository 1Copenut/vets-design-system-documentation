# Capitalization
__Use sentence case capitalization__

We use sentence case capitalization for most content, including page titles, headings, subheadings, buttons, and text links unless a word is a proper noun. Don't capitalize common words for emphasis or importance.

__Exceptions where we use title capitalization__ 

- Proper nouns (example: branded terms like "VA.gov," official program names, state names, names of federal agencies, days of the week and months, compositions such as titles of books, etc.)
- The word “Veterans”
- Global navigation, top menu labels (VA Benefits and Health Care; About VA; Find a VA Location) 
- SEO browser titles

[Consult our word list](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/vets-design-system-documentation/content-style-guide/word-list.html) or refer to AP Style if you're not sure a term should be capitalized. If still unsure, err on the side of sentence case capitalization.
