# Featured content

<p class="va-introtext">Call attention to important blocks of content.</p>

Features are typically used to describe eligibility requirements.

<div class="site-c-showcase">
{% include_relative _html/featured-content.html %}
</div>

{% include snippet.html content='_html/featured-content.html' %}

## Guidance

* Features should use a `h3` or `h4` heading
* Also supports open text, such as `<p>`, `<ul>`, and `<ol>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, and `<a>`
