# Documentation for designers

<div class="va-introtext">
Designers are urged to read through each section of design.va.gov and see all components and patterns in use on VA.gov. The utilities section is also useful to help foster ideas in how a particular design solution can be constructed.
</div>

## Design resources

The website displays HTML and CSS examples of the various components and patterns in use on VA.gov. You can use your browserâ€™s web inspector to view the specs for each component. However, if you use Sketch, each of these components have been added to a pattern library as well.
