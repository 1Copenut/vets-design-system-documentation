# Documentation

<div class="va-introtext">
Formation provides design guidelines and code to help you quickly create trustworthy, accessible, and consistent digital services on the VA.gov platform.
</div>

## Backed with the U.S. Web Design System

Formation was created with the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov) in its underlying foundation, on top of which we have added components, design patterns, and other features unique to the needs of the VA.gov platform, all tested with Veterans to meet our usability and accessibility guidelines.
