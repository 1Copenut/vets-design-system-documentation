### January 23, 2019

**3.0.0**

In this release we are splitting Formation into two modules: formation and formation-react. The regular formation module contains the styles and assets used to render a site using the VA design system. In the future it will also include plain JS implementations of components with interactivity.

The `formation-react` module contains all the React component implementations we've built for design system patterns.

Both are starting on v3, but will not necessarily be kept in sync going forward.

To upgrade, update any paths in your React code to point to `formation-react` instead of `formation`.
