# Tables

<p class="va-introtext">Tables show tabular data in columns and rows.</p>

<div class="site-c-showcase">
{% include_relative html/tables.html %}
</div>

```html
{% include_relative html/tables.html %}
```


## Accessibility
* Simple tables can have two levels of headers. Each header cell should have `scope="col"` or `scope="row"`.
* Complex tables are tables with more than two levels of headers. Each header should be given a unique id and each data cell should have a headers attribute with each related header cellâ€™s id listed.
* When adding a title to a table, include it in a `<caption>` tag inside of the `<table>` element.

## Usability

### When to use
* When you need tabular information, such as statistical data.

### When to consider something else
* Depending on the type of content, consider using other presentation formats such as definition lists or hierarchical lists.

### Guidance
* Tables are great at displaying tabular data. Minimal visual styling helps surface this information more easily.
